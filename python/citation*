Below is the best and efficient code, but because CodeHS has some bugs, 
its not working, or maybe I did something wrong, but I highly doubt it

First_name = input("First name: ")
Last_name = input("Last name: ")


print("Full name: " + First_name + ", " + Last_name)

First_name, Last_name = Last_name, First_name
print("Citation: " + First_name + ", " + Last_name)
